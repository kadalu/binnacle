= Quick Start

Binnacle is a simple Test framework with the focus on Tester's delight.

Download and install using the following commands. Ruby should be installed on the machine where it needs to work.

[source,console]
----
$ curl -L https://github.com/kadalu/binnacle/releases/download/0.2.0/binnacle -o binnacle
----

Make the binnacle file executable.

[source,console]
----
$ chmod +x ./binnacle
----

Move the binary in to your PATH.

[source,console]
----
$ sudo mv ./binnacle /usr/local/bin/binnacle
----

Test to ensure the version you installed is up-to-date

[source,console]
----
$ binnacle --version
----

Lets write a quick test file that tests a file exists or not

[source,ruby]
----
# file: hello.t
TEST "stat /var/www/html/index.html"
----

Now run this test file by running,

[source,console]
----
$ binnacle hello.t -v
1..1
# stat: /var/www/html/index.html: stat: No such file or directory
not ok   1 - node=local cmd="TEST stat /var/www/html/index.html"
TOTAL: 1  PASSED: 0  FAILED: 1  SKIPPED: 0  TODOs: 0
Result: FAIL
----

If that file exists then it will print the output as below

[source,console]
----
$ binnacle hello.t -v
1..1
ok       1 - node=local cmd="TEST stat /var/www/html/index.html"
TOTAL: 1  PASSED: 1  FAILED: 0  SKIPPED: 0  TODOs: 0
Result: PASS
